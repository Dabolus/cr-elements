# cr-elements

The Clash Royale elements are a set of UI components designed to implement Clash Royale's design.

### Current Priorities

With the `cr-elements` I'm trying to bring to the web the Clash Royale UI elements.

Each of these elements should be:

1. As much similar as possible to their in-game counterpart
2. Easy to use and ready out of the box
